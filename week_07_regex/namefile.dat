Miss Helena Wolf also went by Mrs. Helen Mueller

Helen was born on Jan 30th, 1947 in Linton, North Dakota, the daughter of Joseph and Helen Wolf.  She grew up on a working farm with her nine siblings.  She moved to Minneapolis at age 17 and then attended the University of Minnesota School of Drama.  In 1973 she was in the Miss Minnesota Pageant and was named “Miss Snowcrest”.  Having moved to Chicago, she worked for the New York Life Insurance Co. as an Executive Administrative Assistant.  It was at New York Life that she met the love of her life and soul mate Rob Mueller, (her “Rolls Royce”).  They married in 1990 and started their life’s journey together.  Helen and Rob traveled the U.S., many international countries, playing golf, appreciating various cultures, and collecting art from their travels.  Helen and Rob enjoyed retirement to Tucson in 1994 and in 2002 moved to Prescott to continue their love for the good life and the game of golf at the Prescott Lakes Golf Club.   

She enjoyed her life and fashion immensely and touched many people throughout her lifetime. Helen is already terribly missed by her family, friends and her dear “Fur Kiddo”, Felix.
